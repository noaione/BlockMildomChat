# Block Mildom Chat
A simple Chrome extension that will block any chat connection for Mildom.com

The reason I made this is because mildom chat takes a lot of resources and sometimes lagged out the stream I'm watching.

Currently it will just block the channel chat.

## Install
Until I get permission to publish it, please download the file on [Release Tab](https://github.com/noaione/BlockMildomChat/releases)
